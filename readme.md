This is mainly just for my online Discord skins.


If nothing seems to work or background is not changing visibly or getting overlapped

Go to vencord or betterdiscord
 - Go to settings and plugins
 - Search Experiments and enable it then restart
 - Now go to settings again and scroll down till you find experiments
 - Then search up "Desktop Visual Refresh" and set it to "Treatment 0: Control"

If you are on mac, it's better to upload your skins in github and paste your theme in the Online Themes section.
Example: (you should prefix which mode you are using just incase the theme doesnt go batshit)
@dark https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceikros/CeiCss/refs/heads/main/BlackOrWhite.css
@light https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceikros/CeiCss/refs/heads/main/BlackOrWhite.css

Where to upload backgrounds? (Images or Gifs)
catbox.moe (upto 200mb)
github (max is 25mb)
discord (if you have nitro)
